17/06 2018 [DAY 12] Nausea

I spent the night in my bunk with pillows and my backpack on my side to limit my movements.

I could hear the waves breaking on the hull and rolling on the deck.
Yoav, our skipper, and the crew were handling over 30 knots of wind on deck with heavy rain. Those conditions did not stop, the waves stayed with us the rest of the day, only the rain and wind had stopped. Those conditions made it impossible for me to swim. Each time I stood up nausea came back, I stayed in my bunk most of the day.
