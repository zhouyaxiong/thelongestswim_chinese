17/06 2018 [DAY 11] Sea sickness

I had a good start Ty and Lauren were on the RHIB and I was trying to get back into my swimming routine. About two hours in the RHIB stopped, Ty told me they had lost power and called Seeker to check on the error they were getting with our Torqeedo engine. The RHIB is powered by an electric engine that relies on 2 big batteries. Apparently, the code indicated that there no more charge, very odd since last night we were at over 90%.

By that time the wind had picked up and the waves got bigger. It was pretty scary sitting in the RHIB next to Seeker and watching the big waves lift her hull out of the water.

We managed to get on Seeker safely.

I asked to have Seeker lead me so that I could resume swimming.
The set up took awhile, I was getting cold and decided to seat down below decks away from the wind. After one hour of waiting,  I was getting seasick again. Maks came to check on me, and we decided to call it a day. It was just in time for me to run up on deck and vomit overboard, as I was emptying myself few dolphins swam few feet off our port side since I had my eyes right on them I spotted them first and yelled out sharks. A few seconds later I corrected myself and everybody was on deck.

The winds were still picking up and I knew we were going to have a rough night.
