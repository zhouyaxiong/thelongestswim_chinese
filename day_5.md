2018年6月10日 第五天 风暴

The storm is nearly passed, so it looks like I’ll be continuing my swim across the Pacific soon. It is time to put all those feelings of setback behind me and focus on using our time waiting out the storm to increase our chance of success at sea. Paul called on a meeting, we were all attentive around his favorite whiteboard as he went through our to-do list and assigned the tasks. The compilation of the list was a group effort, everybody had their input about how we could improve what we had and any fixing that needed happen.

风暴即将过去，看过来我横渡太平洋的计划就要重新开始了。是时候将所有挫折抛在脑后，在等待风暴过去的时候，专注于眼前以增加成功的机会。保罗召开了一次会议，当他在最爱的白板上过一遍任务列表并分配任务的时候，我们都专心致志的围绕在旁边。汇总任务列表是我们集体的努力，每个人都可以提意见，每个人都可以对如何改进我们的工作，如何修复我们的错误畅所欲言。

We were very fortunate that Ras our engineer who was part of the delivery of the boat to Japan was still around and always enthusiastic to work on the preparation of Seeker. Dina, our food queen who like Ras was part of the delivery, was also on deck ready to assist with the same enthusiasm and her contagious smile.

非常幸运，Ras是将船运到日本的一员，现在仍然充满激情的在防鲨船上做准备工作。Dian，我们的食品女王，和Ras一样，是运输队的一员，现在以同样的热情我迷人的微笑在协助工作。

To see how unified was our team and dedicated to getting us back to sea to resume the swim, boosted my spirit. We were all focused on our individual tasks and went on spending our day checking them off the board.

看到我的团队如此的齐心，为了能重返海洋继续游泳，这激发了我的斗志。我们每个人都专注于自己的工作，工作了一天后，在任务的白板上核对任务列表是否完成。
