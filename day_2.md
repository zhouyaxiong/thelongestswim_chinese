Day 2
第二天

I woke up around 6 am, I wasn’t too stiff, and overall had a good night. My night was interrupted by my midnight meal, a plate of pasta and my regular bathroom stops.

我早上六点醒了，身体并不是太僵硬，总体来说整个晚上挺不错的。夜里被夜餐打断，吃了一盘意大利面，还有一次打断是夜间常规的如厕。

I went on deck and found Yoav, our skipper making adjustments to the sails. We had drifted over night more than expected and had to sail back to the spot I finished my swim the previous day. It took us a good part of the morning to get back to our position and unfortunately I know I would not have a full day of swimming. Ty was at the helm for most part of the morning and spotted a 3 foot long shark.

我到甲板上去找Yoav，我们的船长正在对船帆进行一些调整。夜里我们比预期漂移了太多，我们不得不返回昨天完成游泳的地点。上午我们花了好大一部分时间来返回昨日的地点，不幸的是我知道今天不能游一天泳了。早上Ty大部分时间都在掌舵，发现了一条3英尺长的鲨鱼。

I was a little anxious before going in the water not because of the shark but because of the water temperature, I put an extra layer on and hope it would be enough to keep me warm.

在入水以前我有点小紧张，不是因为鲨鱼，而是因为水温，我多穿了一层，希望能让我保持温暖。

Ty and Maks were on the RHIB and lead me in the right direction. The extra layer did the trick. After the first two hours I was back into my routine, letting my imagination guide me into my parallel universe. On the deep blue static backdrop in front of my eyes, images of my family started to form.

Ty和Maks在船上指引我正确的方向。我多穿的那层有神奇的效果。两个小时以后我进入了状态，我的想象指引我进入了平行宇宙。在眼前这无垠的深蓝色背景之下，想象出我的家人。

Every 30 minutes, Ty and Maks stopped me to feed me, Maks had some warm soup ready, my stomach enjoyed that.

每30分钟，Ty和Maks都会让我停下来吃饭，Maks会准备一些热汤，我的胃很享受这个。

My hands felt the cold each time they were out of the water and the top of my shoulder as well. It started raining and the air was colder than the water. During my feeding time, I noticed that Ty and Maks started to put on more layers and our visibility started to diminish.

我的手每次出水都会感到特别的冷，我的肩膀上面也是如此。天开始下雨，空气比水要冷了。在我吃饭的时候，我注意到Ty和Maks开始穿更多衣服，我们的视野开始减小。

After about 5 hours Maks grabbed my hands to assess my body temperature, his hands were colder than mine. Both of them looked pretty miserable and were getting cold. Since our visibility was dropping and we were losing light I decided to swim another 1/2 hour before stopping for the day, at times we could not see Seeker, stopping was a wise thing to do.

大约5个小时以后，Maks抓住我的手开始检测我的体温，他的手比我还冷。他们两个都已经冻的上牙打下牙了，情况还在恶化。因为我们的视野已经缩小，视线模糊，我决定再游半个小时就结束今天的行程，有时候我们无法看到防鲨船，此时收手是个明智的举动。

Before going to bed we got another report from our weather routing partner that warned us of the system they have been tracking, it was developing faster and stronger than expected.

在将要上床睡觉的时候，我们从合作伙伴那里收到了天气预报，在我们要经过的路线上天气不好，比预期的要强烈。
