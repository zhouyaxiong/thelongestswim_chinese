 [DAY 3] A storm is coming
第三天 暴风雨就要来了

If there is something I learned that is most helpful in my situation, this is it: there is a long list of forces outside of my control that I can’t change, this only thing I can change is the way I think about them and react.

如果问，在我这种处境之下，我学到的最有用的东西是什么？我的答案是：我不能控制的东西太多了，我唯一能控制的就是如何面对他们。

Weather is on top of this list, I knew it was going to be a big factor in this expedition. The low pressure system developing in the south west of us near China and moving to the north east is growing, swiping a broad area from south to north and west to east. Our Weather service advised us the threat had grown so much we needed to get of out the direct path.

天气是不可控的因素之首，我知道在这次探险中天气是最大的因素。低气压在我们的西南方向，靠近中国的地方形成，正在向东北方向移动，从南到北，从东到西的大片区域会受影响。我们的天气预报服务建议我们离开这片区域，因为风险正在增加。

For the sake of the overall effort, the only option for us was to go back towards land and anchor in a protected location, let the system pass and then sail back to where I stopped to resume swimming. Once we will be out in the open ocean and face those systems we would only be able to try to get away from them or if not we would have to ride them.

为了顾全大局，我们唯一的选择就是返回陆地并且抛锚在有保护的区域，让风过去然后我们再返回到我停下来的地方，继续游泳。一旦我们在开阔的海洋里，面对这些风浪，要么我们尝试摆脱它们，要么我们要不得不战胜它们。

As I am writing on deck overlooking this majestic ocean, I can’t stop thinking how lucky and privileged I am. Thanks to all of you who are following and supporting us, this is important day: Happy World Oceans Day!

当我在甲板上写作的时候，我远眺这浩瀚的海洋，忍不住想到自己是何等的幸运。感谢所有关注我支持我的人，今天是重要的一天，国际海洋节快乐！

The ocean can live without us but we can’t live without it.

大海没有我们可以存在，但是没有大海我们将无法生存。
