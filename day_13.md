[DAY 13] Light

The daylight starts early here before 5 am it lights up the galley through 5 hatches. My day will start in about an hour but I stay laying on the bench, enjoying this quiet moment with the light shining through the openings. The light will be here every morning no matter what. There are few things that will never change and that I can count on, the light is one of them. I sleep in the galley now, I like the space and how I get all the light in the morning. My cabin is dark with only one small hatch.

The light was amazing today, it kept me in good spirit.
We had some technical issues with the batteries of our RHIB and couldnâ€™t use it. Instead, I had Lauren pace me on the green Kayak, Max Attack, we named it after my son Max. The yellow Kayak is Ban Ana, named after my daughter Ana.

It was a challenging task for Lauren, she had to keep the course, give a report to Seeker every 30 minutes, feed me and check on my state.
The light never disappointed me, it put up an incredible show, bouncing off it rays from millions of planktons right below me. The water was so rich that at times I could not see the color blue of the ocean anymore the white light took over.

In the middle of the day, Lauren stopped, the paddle had broken. She radioed Seeker and I stayed in the water while we waited to get a replacement. This was torture, I was getting cold and knew I would be difficult to warm myself up. I resumed swimming and tried to increase my pace to get warmer. I focused on the beautiful show that was taking place right below me, I love that light, but at the end, I was still getting colder and had to call it a day.
