12/06 2018 [DAY 6] Story telling

The wind had faded early on in the day and the light rain didn’t stop until the evening, the storm had passed. As we prepare to begin the swim we also are having to say goodbye to one of our crew, my friend Gino, who is returning to his life on land in the United States.

白天的时候，风已经停了，雨到了傍晚才停止，风暴过去了。当我们准备开始游泳的时候，我不得不和团队里的一位伙伴说再见，我的朋友Gino，他要回美国的土地上生活了。

He always gets into interesting situations and I wanted to make this day a fun one spent with him; yesterday evening he shared with us many stories, from the time he just got to the US from Turkey, when he found himself on Daytona Beach, Florida in his tiger print speedo during spring break and not knowing what spring break was to the most recent time when he realized he was on stage performing with the wrong band. We had a great time together and I took in as much as I could, so that I could relive these moments in a few days when I will be swimming thinking about the smell, the light, the noise that I knew I will be missing. Thank you my friend for these moments!

他总是对一切充满好奇，我也希望和他度过的一天成为美好的回忆；昨天晚上他分享给我们许多有趣的故事，从他刚从土耳其到美国的时候，在春假里，他在美国佛罗里达的代托纳比奇穿着他的老虎花纹的泳装，然后并不知道什么是春假是什么，一直到最近他在舞台上演砸了的趣事。我们在一起有快乐的时光，我享受其中，几天后我再次游泳的时候，我会重温这些时光，我会怀念你的音容笑貌，和一起的点点滴滴。感谢你，我的朋友，这些日子以来的陪伴。
