09/06 2018 [DAY 4] World Oceans Day
2018年6月9日 第四天 

We spent our Ocean Day adjusting our course to get out of the path of the storm and that meant moving backwards. I had mix feelings when I first saw land again.  I was slowly starting to seep into my rhythm of swimming, sleeping, and eating and yet this big developing weather system forced us to turn back for cover.

我们花了海洋日这一天的时间来调整我们的路线，以便能避开暴风，这也意味着我们要走回头路。我再次看到陆地的时候，百感交集。我慢慢的让我的游泳，睡觉和饮食都进入了状态，但是，这个强烈的暴风雨让我不得不回来寻找避风港。

The lush vegetation on the hills around Choshi stood tall on the horizon. We followed the coastline sailing south to get back to Yokohama, this was the only port in the region that could accommodate us in such short notice.

环绕千叶县的山上，郁郁葱葱的树木高耸于地平线之上。我们沿着海岸线向南返回横滨，这是该地区唯一可以在短时间内容纳我们的港口。

It was very comfortable on deck, a light breeze kept us cool. I was scanning the water surface for any sign of activity in the water.  We were surrounded by small fishing boats but all I could see was floating debris, small pieces of plastic or foam were pupping every so often. The color of the water had changed from a clear deep blue to a murky dark green.

在甲板上非常舒服，凉风习习。我观察水面，看看有什么风吹草动。我们被小渔船所包围，但是我能看到的都是一些小浮动的小碎片，塑料或者泡沫每隔一段时间就会扑过来。水也由清澈的深蓝变成了黑暗的深绿色。

This alone brought me back to reality and the purpose of our expedition. The way we live on land, our daily activities and behavior have a direct negative impact on the ocean and put it in peril. More than ever I am determined to use this amazing expedition as a platform to get attention to this issue and invite the audience to think about how we can all make some changes in our daily routine to become a better steward of the ocean and protect it as we cannot live without it.

这让我的思绪回到了现实，还有思考这次探险的目的。我们在陆地上的生活方式，我们的日常生活和行为对海洋有直接负面的影响，并且将海洋带入危险的境地。我比以往任何时候都更想以这个惊人的探险来引起人们对这种行为的关注，并邀请观众思考我们如何做出一些改变，成为一个更好的海洋管家，并保护海洋，没有它，我们将无法生存。

Please share in the comment some of the actions you have been taking to make a difference, invite and inspire others to do the same, Happy Oceans Day!
