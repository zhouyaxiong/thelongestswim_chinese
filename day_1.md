第一天
2018年6月5日

It was a day loaded with emotions; I was finally going to start the swim after so many years dreaming about it and 7 years of tumultuous preparations, I couldn’t be more excited about it. But it was also difficult to know that I was leaving my friends and family behind.

今天是百感交集的一天；多年的梦想，7年动荡不安的准备，终于在这一天开始下水了，心中有按耐不住的兴奋。但是，对家人和朋友难舍难分。

During the drive to the beach, my children and my wife didn’t say much, it was an intense quiet moment, no word could have made the situation less painful. Once we got to the beach it wasn’t our moment anymore, the press was present asking me questions and the local public and officials came to wish me a safe swim. I hugged my wife one last time, no words were exchanged, I asked Ana and Max, my children, to wait until I was ready in the water to join me and swim the first 50 meters with me. The water was cold, I wore a wetsuit but they did not. Max was a little hesitant at the beginning then he dove and lead Ana and me toward the open ocean. I had to grab his leg twice to put him in the right direction as he was swimming straight toward some big rocks. Once we were out I stopped them and the three of us hugged one last time. They turned around and I waited for them to reach the beach before swimming off.

在开车去海滩的路上，我的孩子和妻子没有说太多，那是无言的时刻，此时无声能减轻离别的痛苦。一旦到达海边，时间就不再属于我们了，媒体来采访我，当地官员来给我送行。我最后一次拥抱我的妻子，彼此没有话语，我告诉我的孩子，Ana和Max，当我准备好以后，陪我游最初的50米。水非常冷，我穿了防寒的泳衣，但是他们没有。刚开始Max有点犹豫，但是他还是跳进水里带领Ana和我游向广阔的大海。我不得不两次抓住他的腿，让他游向正确的方向，因为他游向了一些大石头。当我们游出以后，我叫住了他们，最后我们三个最后一次拥抱。我看着他们两个游回岸边，然后开始了我的旅程。

That was it, I was on my own with my thoughts and swimming on top of my streamline that leads me in the right direction.



Within the first 30 minutes, I was back into my routine, keeping a steady pace, stretching my shoulders to glide as much as possible and focusing on my streamline. Already in the first hour, I was reliving the moment I spent on the beach few minutes before, everything happened so fast I wanted to remember and relive some moments that I didn’t have the time to enjoy.

In the second hour, the water temperature started to drop and it became uncomfortable as the day progressed.

在第二个小时，水温开始下降，随着时间流逝，水温变的越来越不舒服。

In the fifth hour, my support RHIB got a call from Seeker to let us know that they had spotted a 5 foot long shark. They were sending out our medic Maks on a kayak to bring us our shark protection device. Before Maks got to us I saw a 3 foot long shark swimming right below me in the opposite direction. I stopped to look around but couldn’t see anything, I had limited visibility. Paul and Ty who were on the RHIB asked if I wanted to get out of the water but I decided it was safe to continue swimming so I just did.

在第五个小时，我的支持船接到了防鲨船上的电话，让我们知道他们发现了一条5英尺长的鲨鱼。他们已经让我们的医生Maks带着防鲨设备坐着皮划艇过来了。在Maks到达我们这边以前，我看到了一条3英尺长的鲨鱼从我的身下相反的方向游过。我停下来观察，没有发现什么情况，我视力受限。Paul和Ty在支持船上问我要不要上船，但是我认为没什么问题，就决定继续游泳。

Few moments later Maks joined us with the kayak and asked me few questions to access my state, he took my pulse and felt my hands and decide that I was getting cold and asked me to stop, he said “Ben it was a good day, you swam for 6 hours, it is good start, let’s not over do it”.

一会儿，Maks坐着皮划艇到了，他问了我几个问题以便确认我的状况，他测了我的脉并感受了我的双手，认为我正在变冷并要求我现在停止，他说：“Ben，今天是非常好的一天，你游了6个小时，这是一个好的开始，我们不要过犹不及。”

So I jumped in the RHIB and got back to Seeker to start my first night onboard. My stomach was a little upset and I could not hold much food at the beginning but it got better through out the night and wake up few times for a night snake.

我上了支持船然后又到了防鲨船，开始了我

Tomorrow will be another day.

明天是新的一天。
